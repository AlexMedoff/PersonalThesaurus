This unofficial WordHippo API uses [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) to fetch HTML documents from wordhippo.com, then initializes jQuery on the response document body using [mu.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mu.js) (a convenient wrapper of [cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio)) to extract the values from the virtual Document Object Model (DOM).

## Some examples

const WordHippo = require('.')

WordHippo.definition('chair').then(console.log) // A person in charge of a meeting

WordHippo.related('stress').then(words => {
    console.log(words)

  'distress',            'nervousness',      'tenseness',
  'hassle', ... 101 more
]
*/
})

WordHippo.opposites('productive').then(console.log) 
/*

  'inefficient',        'inoperative',     'unfruitful',

  'dead',   ... 73 more items
]
*/

async (() => {
    await WordHippo.sentences('empty') 
/*
[
    'When she had finished, Rebekah picked up the empty wicker basket and turned to go inside.',
    'I stroll to the other end of the hall and the waitress seats me at an empty table.',
    'Mrs Watson gets to her feet and walks us back to our homeroom, which is empty because everyone has gone to class.',

}

WordHippo.rhymes('slam').then(words => {
    console.log(`slam rhymes with ${words[0]} and ${words[1]}`) // slam rhymes with jam and program
})
```

This function will call all of the above methods and will resolve an Object. It will also cache the word data to a JSON file in the cache folder if the second argument is not changed so that we only have to query WordHippo for a word once and not consume too much bandwidth.

```js 
WordHippo.getWord('apprehensive').then(meta => {
    console.log(meta)
})

// ignore cache and fetch again
WordHippo.getWord('apprehensive', true).then(meta => {
    console.log(meta)
})
